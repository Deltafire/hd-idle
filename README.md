# hd-idle

This is a fork of Christian Mueller's [original](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hd-idle) C implementation of hd-idle, a tool to spin-down external disks after a period of idle time. See README for more information.

Based on version 1.06, with the following additional features:

- Foreground mode (-f option).
- Suspend/sleep detection.
